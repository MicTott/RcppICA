Description: Fast Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using the
    FastICA algorithm implemented in C++ with Eigen for linear algebra,
    Spectra for efficient truncated eigendecomposition, and OpenMP for
    parallelization. Supports both dense and sparse matrices, deflation
    and parallel (symmetric) algorithms, and multiple nonlinearity
    functions. Optimized whitening provides superior performance compared
    to base fastICA.
