Description: Fast Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using the
    FastICA algorithm implemented in C++ with Eigen for linear algebra,
    Spectra for efficient truncated eigendecomposition, and OpenMP for
    parallelization. Spectra-based whitening computes only top-k eigenvalues,
    providing 2-3x speedup over full eigendecomposition and competitive
    performance with base fastICA. Supports both dense and sparse matrices,
    deflation and parallel (symmetric) algorithms, and multiple nonlinearity
    functions.
