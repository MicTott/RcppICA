Description: Fast Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using the
    FastICA algorithm implemented in C++ with Eigen for linear algebra,
    Spectra for truncated eigendecomposition, and OpenMP for parallelization.
    Memory-efficient whitening avoids materializing intermediate matrices.
    Sparse matrix support enables ICA on large datasets by computing
    covariance without densification. Supports deflation and parallel
    (symmetric) algorithms, and multiple nonlinearity functions (logcosh,
    exp, cube).
